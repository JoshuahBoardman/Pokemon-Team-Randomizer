# Pokemon Team Randomizer

## Description
An app that allows users to generate Pokemon teams.

## Motive
I wanted to make an app that allowed players of the Pokemon franchise to have a tool to generate teams for challenge runs of the games. I also wanted to improve my understanding of working with APIs. 

## What I Learned 
I improved my grasp on interacting with APIs, such as rendering a new pokemon if the previous render failed. I also now understand how to use grid template columns more effectively.
